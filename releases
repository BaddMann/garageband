Revision notes:
    1.0:    Initial commit
    1.0.1b: Switched to urllib2 with better error handling and implemented
            progress bar, added functions for obtaining the package file
            size, and reporting this in list output.
            Sanitised the list output to only return remote url of package.
    1.0.2b: Fixed the rounding errors, and switched to getting the file size
            remotely rather than from the plist.
    1.0.3b: Found a number of additional loops that aren't listed in the 2015
            GarageBand plist file, so added those in. Also found the 2013
            plist file, so switch to using that. This may result in a couple
            of extraneous packages downloaded.
            Also added a test to check if the file is already downloaded and
            if so, skip the download.
            When killing the script via KeyboardInterrupt, the script now
            cleans up folders, and exits somewhat more gracefully.
            Note - this clean up will remove any and all completed downloads!
    1.0.4b  Added support for Logic Pro X audio content. Ignores duplicate
            package paths based on URL, as GarageBand and Logic Pro X share
            similar packages for content.
            Added the -p flag to choose between either 'garageband' or
            'logicpro' content. If the -p flag is not supplied, defaults to
            GarageBand, as the Logic Pro X content is crazy big.
            Added -v flag for verbose output. Default is to be quiet, this
            means list output will not check remote file size unless the -v
            flag is passed.
    1.0.7b  Various fixes for handling relative paths and variables in paths
            better. Updated command line arguments.
